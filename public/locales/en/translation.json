  "about-text-top": "I became a web engineer when I was in college, when I became interested in web service development and started learning HTML and CSS on my own.  Later, I began to learn this field in earnest when a website I created for myself as a hobby was well received by people around me and I was fascinated by the ever-evolving development of web technology. After working for a company, I am now working as a freelancer. I have learned that it is important to keep learning amidst the fast pace of technological innovation. In addition to the skills I have honed through self-study, I aim to be an engineer who can flexibly respond to the needs of each individual client while always checking the latest trends. I hope to continue to grow with the development of technology.",
  "about-text-bottom": "Outside of the coding world, I enjoy traveling and learning foreign languages. I also enjoy playing games, DJing, pencil drawing as a hobby, and practicing piano in my free time.",
